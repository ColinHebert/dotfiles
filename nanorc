set casesensitive

# Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
set const

set fill "-8"

# Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.
set historylog

# Set the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket searches. They cannot contain blank characters. The former set must come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order. The default value is "(<[{)>]}".

# Don't add newlines to the ends of files.
unset nonewlines

# Don't wrap text at all.
unset nowrap

# nano will only read and write files inside directory and its subdirectories. Also, the current directory is changed to here, so files are inserted from this diractory. By default, the operating directory feature is turned off.
# set operatingdir "directory"

# Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
unset preserve

# Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying paragraphs. They cannot contain blank characters. Only closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end sentences. The default value is "!.?".

# Do quick statusbar blanking. Statusbar messages will disappear after 1 keystroke instead of 25.
unset quickblank

# The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs. This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them, otherwise a literal string. The default value is "^([ \t]*[#:>\|}])+" if you have extended regular expression support, or "> " otherwise. Note that '\t' stands for a literal Tab character.
set quotestr "^([ \\t]*[#:>\\|}])+"

unset rebinddelete

# Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly. You should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support won't work properly with this option enabled.
unset rebindkeypad

# Do extended regular expression searches by default.
unset regexp

# Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.
